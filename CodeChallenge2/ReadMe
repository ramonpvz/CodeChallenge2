:::TIPS:::
1. Linking two VCs using a Table View>Table View Cell.
    The "Table View Cell" is linked to the target view controller (Story board).
    The origin VC implements the following method to pass the corresponding data:
        - (void) prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender
        *Method intercepted on the tap event.
2. Linking UILabel to View Controller.
    Add a "Tap Gesture Recognizer" over the UILabel.
    Once the Gesture is over the label;
    Link using the Gesture -> Triggered Segues, and drag/link to the target View Controller.
